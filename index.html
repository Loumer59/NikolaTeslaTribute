        <p id="importance">Nikola Tesla's place in history has a noncontestable importance and not because he invented AC power, radio, tesla coil, hydroelectric power, radio controlled boat and other numerous inventions. But also he, in spite of the hardships he encountered, made the world a better place and inspired many dreamers and idealists.</p>

                <strong>10 July 1856</strong> - He was born on around midnight, during a fierce lightning storm. The nurses believed it to be a bad omen and said that he will be a child of "darkness". His mother had said that on the contrary, he will be a <strong>child of light.</strong> 
            </li>
            <li>
                His father, Milutin, was an orthodox priest with a respectable education and his mother had a talent for crafting home tools and mechanical appliances. He also had four brothers. When he was 6 or 7 years old, his older brother Dane died in a horse-riding accident.

            <li>
                During his childhood, Tesla was greatly inspired by a Hungarian novel called <strong><q>Abafi</q></strong>, written by Miklós Jósika. The novel featured the story
                of Olivér Abafi, a young impulsive nobleman and hedonist, recast as a valiant national hero who sacrifices himself for the wellbeing of the country. Tesla was particularly inspired by the character of the protagonist, seeing in his desire to better his moral character while ignoring frivolous distractions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1870</strong> - Tesla began attending a high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German.  Tesla later wrote that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor. Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this "mysterious phenomena" made him want "to know more of this wonderful force". Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating. He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in <strong>1873</strong>.

            <h2 id="Youth">Youth</h2>
            <li>
                <strong>1873</strong> - After graduating, Tesla became very sick with a range of maladies sufficiently serious enough for the doctors treating him to nearly give up on his case entirely. Throughout his recuperation Tesla began voraciously reading, and it was during this period that he was first introduced to the tales of Mark Twain. It was a story he would later recount to Mark Twain himself, who burst into tears upon hearing it.
            </li>
            <li>
                While fatally ill, Tesla told his father that perhaps he would recover if he allowed him to study engineering instead of entering priesthood, which was his fathers wish. Milutin, desperate to avoid the unbearable pain of losing another son, to solemnly promise that Nikola would go to the best technical institution in the world. Having finally been heard, Tesla made a miraculous recovery.
            </li>
            <li>
                 <em>However</em>, before he could become a student he was sent to the Croatian mountains with nothing but a bundle of books and some hunting equipment by his father who, worried for his son's health, did everything in his power to hide his son from the authorities, as by law, Tesla would have to serve in the Austrian armed forces for 3 years. For nine months starting in the early fall of 1874, Tesla wandered the forests and lakes of the eastern European countryside, becoming stronger physically and mentally as he thought deeply about inventions that flashed across his mind, such as a pipe installed underwater that could transport letters and packages placed in capsules using the principles of hydraulic pressure, and a ring constructed around the earth's equator that could be used as a high-tech transport network. When Tesla returned, his father had kept his promise to him.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1875</strong> - He enrolled in Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz on a Military Frontier scholarship. During his freshman year, Tesla proved himself to be a perfect student, never once missing a lecture and supposedly studying from 3am to 7pm every day, a schedule that was thought so extreme that one professor wrote to Milutin warning him that unless his son was escorted out of the school, that he might work himself to death, while others commended him for his zeal, such as the Dean of the Technical Faculty who informed Milutin Tesla that his son was          
                quote “a star of first rank.” In fact, Tesla was keeping himself very busy, administering his earliest experiments with alternating current or <strong>>AC</strong> that would later make his name, but during his sophomore year Tesla would be sidetracked, developing a destructive gambling habit and wagering away his entire tuition fund in the process. Near destitute, Tesla had also neglected his studies, scoring extremely poorly in the examinations, and with no marks registered for his final semester, he was also unable to graduate and was forced to abandon the university in December.

            <li>
                <strong>1881</strong> - After 7 years, he had found a job in Budapest working at a telegraph company. where he was drafted in as an electrical engineer by Tivador Puskas, who had previously worked alongside Thomas Edison at the Edison laboratories in Menlo Park. Making himself a valuable employee and sharing his findings with his work colleague Anital Szigety, Tesla continued his study of the concept of the alternate current in his spare time, proposing that a motor driven by circuits that were out of phase could maintain power levels to supply a constant stream of electricity, but in order to make the system function, Tesla realized he needed to figure out how to rotate magnetic fields. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1882</strong> - 1882, Tesla had a sudden stroke of genius and solved the rotating magnetic field problem, going on to explain the concept of the induction motor to his friend by drawing its basic blueprints in the sand with a stick, outlining a new type of engine that unlike its Direct Currentor "DC" counterpart, did not need a commutator, an inefficient cylindrical device segmented with metal that had to be regularly maintained. Impressed by Tesla's genius, Tivador Puskas recommended that Tesla move to Paris to work for his old acquaintance Thomas Edison at his Continental Edison Company, a firm that specialized in electrical equipment. After that conversation, he landed a job at Continental Edison.
            </li>
            <li>
                Tesla continued to advance the AC theory after he was sent to work on a project in Strasbourg, where he built the first induction motor prototype. However, Tesla was unable to garner any serious interest in Alternating Currents. Alternating current is considerably more efficient than direct current. Tesla's error, if it can be defined as such, is that he was simply ahead of his time in trying to propose alternating current as the better method of energy generation. He was correct, but the technology available at the time simply favoured the more crude direct current method.
            </li>
            <h2 id="Moving-to-USA">Moving to USA</h2>
            <li>
                <strong>1884</strong> - Tesla emigrated to USA, as Charles Batchelor (manager of Continental Edison) wanted him to come there as well, and began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 "field engineers" struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1885</strong> - Disassociating himself from Edison and eager to spread the AC gospel, Tesla started his own company in 1885 called the Tesla Electric Light Company with the financial backing of two rich benefactors, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who were certain that the alternating current was the future. Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey. Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.

            <li>
                <strong>1886</strong> - The investors showed little interest in Tesla's ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment. After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing side of the business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility. They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla's company and leaving the inventor penniless. Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock. He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per day. Later in life Tesla recounted that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing "My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery".
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1888</strong> - With the aid of philanthropists Alfred S. Brown and Charles F. Peck, Tesla established another company, this time called the Tesla Electric Company based in Manhattan, New York, where he finalized the designs of the polyphase induction motor, unveiling it to the amazement of the scientific community in 1888, when he presented a landmark paper to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers entitled 'A New System of Alternating Current Motors
                and Transformers.' George Westinghouse, an investor most famous for inventing the railway air brake and head of the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company, was particularly impressed, and his curiosity was piqued in a visit to Tesla's lab a few days later where he was shown an early polyphase prototype.

            <li>
                Then he recruited Tesla as an adviser to serve for 12 months at the Westinghouse plant in Philadelphia where some of the first commercially available AC devices would be produced. The release of the first AC machine in 1886 was the harbinger of a bitter conflict that erupted between Westinghouse and Edison known as the ''War of the Currents', which pitted AC against DC from 1888 to 1892. During the dispute Edison would try to use his resources to sway public opinion in his favor, and despite the evidence clearly showing that AC was safe and more effective over long distances, he issued a number of articles in the biggest publications, warning of the dangers of the alternating current. Edison was unable, however, to convince his largest benefactor of the superiority of DC, and Wall Street wolf John Pierpoint Morgan, who in 1892 merged Edison General Electric with the AC-focused Thomas Houston Company, removed Edison's name to create 'General Electric' and switched entirely to alternating current instruments. With Edison sidelined, the alternating current emerged as the undisputed victor of 'War of the Currents' as Westinghouse increased his annual turnover from 800,000 dollars in 1887 to 4.2 million in 1890, while Tesla was paid around 105,000 dollars in royalties by the end of 1891, a period that also witnessed several other personal and professional triumphs for Tesla, who officially became a US citizen in July 1891 at the same time as he established two personal laboratories in New York, situated at South Fifth Avenue and East Houston Street.

                <strong>1894</strong> - Tesla had gained the admiration of his peers, and was awarded honorary doctoral degrees from Columbia and Yale Universities as well as the Elliot Cresson Medal by the Franklin Institute. More good news followed after the Tesla Electric Company was contracted to build the first ever hydroelectric power-plant at Niagara Falls, a childhood dream of Tesla's that became a reality in 1895 after the first schematics were unveiled. The Niagara facility was an accomplishment that represented the ultimate defeat of the direct energy school of thought, and Tesla was lavished with the highest praise and honors, including even the Order of Danilo from King Nicolas of Montenegro, as his achievement was celebrated worldwide as an important step for the future of humanity.

                <strong>1896</strong> - Having also revealed some of the most innovative functions of the x-ray, Tesla next devised the basic elements of the radio transmitter, and in 1896 built a rudimentary unit that received radio waves. He assessed his new invention at the Gerlach Hotel located on 27th Street in Manhattan where he was living, by sending radio waves to it from his New York laboratory on South 5th Avenue. Tesla presented his insights at an 1898 exhibition at Madison Square Gardens, where he demonstrated a radio-controlled boat he called a Telautomaton, to stunned audiences, and by 1901 he had been awarded with a patent clarifying that he had created a system for transmitting electrical energy.

            <li>
                <strong>1900</strong> - After being commissioned by John Jacob Astor to assemble a new lighting system in a contract worth 100,000 dollars, Tesla relocated his laboratory at Colorado Springs where, disobeying his patron's instructions completely, he decided instead to explore 'terrestrial stationary waves', which he regarded as his greatest discovery. At this rural outpost located far away from the humdrum of New York City, Tesla started to piece together an enormous transmitter powered by millions of volts of electricity at an experimental facility built on the outskirts of the town of Knob Hill, keeping inquisitive onlookers away with an ominous Dante line nailed to the front entrance which read quote: ''Abandon hope, all ye who enter here”.
                </li>
            <li>
                 It was here that Tesla first discovered that the earth had electric potential, and could be employed as a finely tuned conductor to transfer electrical energy without wires, while next noticing that when his experimental Tesla coil was powered, it emitted sparks as far as 30 feet that could be detected by antennae 10 miles away. Realizing that he could now wirelessly transmit signals using the electromagnetic frequencies of the planet, Tesla noted that the discovery of stationary electromagnetic waves and how they interacted with the earth, had far-reaching implications. It was a discovery which Tesla would spend the majority of the rest of his career investigating, as he felt it had the potential to transmit electrical power across large distances without the need for wires, indeed he hoped that his work <strong>could one day provide the whole world with clean and free electrical power </strong>, however as with  so many of Tesla’s ideas, it was funded by investors, such as J.P Morgan who intended to market his inventions for profit and were only prepared to fund research which would garner a return on their investments, thus it would be the all-powerful market forces, that would eventually scupper so many of Tesla’s imaginings.
            </li>
            <li>
                It was during this fertile period of discovery, that Tesla also made some more unorthodox assertions, claiming that he had made contact with extraterrestrial beings, that had triggered a series of ominous beeps that sounded from one of his receivers. Tesla had first heard this strange combination of noise from the device in the middle of the night, and interpreted the regularity of the beeps as a sign that they were being manipulated by an intelligent entity, a theory he publicly advanced in a letter to the American Red Cross in January 1901.

            <li>
                Tesla returned to New York, eager to secure funding for a major invention that would eclipse his scientific rivals who were also investigating wireless systems, such as Reginald Fessenden, Lee de Forest, and in particular Guglielmo Giovanni Maria Marconi, an Italian inventor who became Tesla’s next arch-nemesis after Edison. Eager to keep his May 1899 promise in which he vowed to wirelessly communicate with Paris by 1900, Tesla hunted for a source of funding after patenting the magnifying transmitter he had constructed at Colorado Springs. After convincing J.P Morgan that the wireless transfer of information would make the expensive underwater cables his company used to send transatlantic messages obsolete, Morgan informed Tesla he was willing to support him with a 150,000 dollar investment on the condition that he would own a 51% stake of the inventor’s patents. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1901</strong> - Between 1901 and 1905, with the backing of the biggest financial titan in the world, Nikola Tesla constructed the 187-foot-high transmission tower at Wardenclyffe laboratory, topped with a 68 foot copper dome, which was the first wireless broadcasting system ever built, and was largely powered by a gigantic magnifying transmitter designed to channel large concentrations of electricity to any destination conceivable. Assured that by setting up receivers attached to the ground, he could pick up the electromagnetic waves emitted by the tower anywhere, Tesla was desperate to overshadow his rival Marconi, who in December 1901 at St Johns in Newfoundland was hailed as the inventor of wireless telegraphy by the world’s press, after reporting triumphantly, that he had successfully received the first transatlantic signal sent by colleagues at Poldhu in Cornwall, England.
            </li>
            <li>
                With a jaded Tesla making it explicitly clear in newspaper interviews that he believed Marconi had stolen many of his ideas from the 1890s, and wishing to keep his benefactor onside, he next announced that he was going to create a <strong>World Telegraphy System</strong>, a cutting-edge communication array similar to the World Wide Web of the 1990s, in which individual receivers would pick up messages and news broadcasted by transmitting facilities. Tesla pictured several different types of receiver, one that anticipated the fax machine, by acting as a printer and publishing daily newspapers, one that was a loudspeaker that could play voice messages, and another that was a handheld contraption attached to a vertical wire on a short pole, that could decode radio waves, foreshadowing the modern cellphone.

            <li>
                <strong>1902</strong> - Tesla had moved permanently to Wardenclyffe laboratory and was focusing exclusively on amping up the power levels. Tesla found it hard to sell shares to the moneyed New York elite, who believed the investment was too risky, an appraisal not shared by Tesla, who sold 33,000 dollars of his personal property and borrowed a further 10,000 dollars to realize his dream. Faced with an additional 30,000 dollar bill from Westinghouse for the equipment, a lawsuit from the landlord James Warden, who was taking Tesla to court for not paying property tax, as well as another bill from the phone company who had installed a special line out of the laboratory, Tesla struggled financially. Tesla’s promise to extend the coverage of his system so that it could be detected as far away as Australia failed to persuade Morgan, who in July 1903 let Tesla know that he was unwilling to invest any more capital, a mortal and unexpected blow to the World Telegraphy System that enraged Tesla, who in true mad scientist fashion furiously cranked up the voltage of the magnifying transmitter at Wardenclyffe to the maximum level and hurled lightning bolts into the New York sky.

               </section>
            <li>
                Some believe that Morgan abandoned Wardenclyffe because he was worried that Tesla was going to make the energy completely free for everyone and thus deprive his firm of a lucrative paycheck, while another interpretation contests that Morgan was growing increasingly less confident in the wireless industry, which had been mired in scandal by the actions of Lancelot E. Pike, a conman who stole money convincing to create a wireless network between New York and Philadelphia.
            </li>
            <h2 id="Dark-Times">Dark Times</h2>
            <li>
                After this, Tesla, no longer the darling of electrical engineering, continued to have no luck attracting investors as the breakdown of his Wardenclyffe project had turned academic and public opinion against him, with the once celebrated genius, now painted as a man who could never quite fulfill his promises. Tesla was in a dark place and began spiraling into a true nervous breakdown after the untimely death of his business associate Rankine and the collapse of Canadian Niagara Power in the fall of 1905. A man who was always fascinated with human psychology, in the 1920s Tesla shared his experience of emotional collapse with author George Sylvester Viereck in a well-publicized book on Freudian theory, explaining how in his delirium, he was haunted by images of his deceased brother Dane as well as their mother. Tesla would recover from his breakdown in 1906, and with a new determination to prove himself as a valuable asset, he switched his focus from electrical to mechanical engineering, delving into the science of flight in a bid to raise money so that he could continue his work at Wardenclyffe, which in 1904, due to lack of funds, he had mortgaged to George C. Boldt, the owner of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel where Tesla lived for many years. The result was the invention of a turbine that worked without blades, but Tesla’s contraption was met less than enthusiastically by John James Astor, who refused to invest in the idea in 1909.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>1915</strong> - Over the next 10 years, as his personal wealth began to evaporate, Tesla continued to assess his turbine and to work in conjunction with manufacturers but he was unable to fix a recurring problem that ultimately spelled the project’s doom. Tesla’s inability to secure funding for any of his pursuits, and his penchant for overspending, led to the near emptying of his bank accounts and from 1916, he was forced to file for bankruptcy. Although he was still technically the president and treasurer of the Nikola Tesla Company, over 90% of the company’s stock was owned by friends, bankers, and creditors, and many of his patents by then had expired, leaving Tesla virtually penniless. In a bid to save himself from financial ruin, Tesla launched a lawsuit against Marconi in August 1915, accusing the Italian of illegally patenting radio technology in 1904, but the case went nowhere and Marconi remained the official owner for the time being, with the decision later overturned by the Supreme Court in 1943 only a few months after Tesla’s death.

               </section>
            <li> Consequently, Tesla was forced to earn a living by creating minor inventions and registering several improvements in automobile speedometers, frequency meters, and flow meters which he licensed to Waltham Watch Company in 1918. The company used Tesla’s name as a marketing ploy to sell ‘scientifically built speedometers’, as despite Tesla’s changing circumstances, his name still carried a certain gravitas, and Tesla’s opinions and thoughts still garnered much press interest, such as in 1917 when, presaging the advent of radar technology in the 1930s, he forecast that microwave radiation could be employed to detect ships. In the midst of his financial troubles, Tesla still had his admirers, and in 1915 it was reported by the New York Times that he had jointly won the Nobel Prize for Physics, an honor he was to share with his one-time ally and now bitter enemy Thomas Edison, but when it was presented at the awards ceremony it was instead given to William H. Bragg and his son, as Tesla refused to share the award with his nemesis nor had he forgiven the institute for recognizing Marconi as the pioneer of radio communication technology.</li>

                <strong>1920s</strong> - Despite being lauded for his work in electricity, Nikola Tesla remained poor throughout the 1920s, and because he made only a small income from the royalties he received from licensing his minor inventions he became embroiled in a string of legal disputes.  It was during this decade that Tesla started to retreat from the public eye, living hotel to hotel as an eccentric recluse and spending so much of his time feeding the pigeons in Bryant Park behind the New York Public Library, that one end of the park, Nikola Tesla Corner, now honors his name.

                <img  src="Images/Time_magazine_cover.png" alt="Nikola Tesla on Time magazine" title="Nikola Tesla on Time magazine" id="timemagazine"> <p>In 1931, a young journalist whom Tesla befriended, Kenneth M. Swezey, organized a celebration for the inventor's 75th birthday. Tesla received congratulations from figures in science and engineering such as Albert Einstein, and he was also featured on the cover of Time magazine. The cover caption "All the world's his power house" noted his contribution to electrical power generation. The party went so well that Tesla made it an annual event, an occasion where he would put out a large spread of food and drink—featuring dishes of his own creation. He invited the press in order to see his inventions and hear stories about his past exploits, views on current events, and sometimes baffling claims.</p>

                <strong>1930s</strong> - However, on his 75th birthday in 1931 Nikola Tesla was suddenly back in the spotlight, appearing on the front cover of Time magazine, and thanks to the efforts of a young science writer called Kenneth Swezey, he received over 70 letters of congratulation published in a testimonial volume from some of the most esteemed scientists of the day, including Albert Einstein. Interviewed by Time magazine, Tesla outlined many of his future plans, and confidently disclosed how he was going to disprove Einstein's theory of relativity, how he was unconvinced that energy was released from a split atom.

                Tesla would organize a press conference on his birthday, usually a 6 hour affair where Tesla would speak to a number of reporters and update them about his scientific and personal progress. For example, in 1932, he informed the general public about his desire to build a motor propelled by cosmic rays, and in 1936 he told journalists that he wiggled his toes hundreds of times before he went to bed, an exercise he believed would tone his body and enable him to live until he was 135 years old. The 1934 party was a particular highlight, where Tesla first revealed he was in the process of creating a particle beam weapon, claiming in the New York Times that it could: “…send concentrated beams of particles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 250 miles from a defending nation’s border and will cause armies of millions to drop dead in their  tracks.” Anticipating the later doctrine of ‘Mutually Assured Destruction’ and the concept of nuclear stalemate, Tesla believed his laser beam could end war completely since it was so devastating that every conceivable defensive measure would be useless against it. Tesla tried to attract interest of the US War Department, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device. He was left empty-handed following a desperate attempt to persuade the US government that the laser beam could be a viable World War Two weapon.

                Hampering Tesla in his last ditch attempts to liaise with international governments, was his declining health, which had started to deteriorate in 1937 after he was run over by a taxi and refused to get medical treatment for injuries that he would never recover from. Subsisting on a meager diet of boiled vegetables and warm milk, and making sure to keep three feet away from everyone to avoid catching germs, Tesla’s personal health choices led to no improvements, and by 1942 he was spending the majority of his days confined to his bed where his grip on reality started to loosen, when in July, for example, Tesla tried to send money to Mark Twain who had died in 1913. Opting to see only a select few visitors, including the exiled prince of Yugoslavia Peter II and a young scientist called Bloyce Fitzgerald, the creator of an anti-tank gun who would come to discuss inventions, Tesla isolated himself from the world as he deteriorated.

            <li><strong>7th of January 1943</strong> Nikola Tesla died of a heart attack in his sleep at his executive suite in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker, where he had been living for the previous 10 years. Inundated with letters of condolence from major scientific and political figures all over the world, such as Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of the US President, the vice-president Henry Wallace, and a host of nobel laureates, Tesla’s funeral took place at St John the Divine Cathedral in New York City on the 12th of January, where it was attended by over 2000 people and presided over by members of the Serbian Orthodox Church.
